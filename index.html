                <h1>Zeyu (Edward)<br>Qi<span class="wave">👋</span></h1>
                <p class="intro">
                    I’m a fourth-year <strong>Data Science and Biology</strong> student at UC San Diego (Class of ’26).
                    I thrive on turning complex data into real-world solutions. From fine-tuning transformer models to building end-to-end prediction pipelines, 
                    I bridge the gap between messy datasets and actionable insights.
                </p>
                <p class="bio">
                    In and outside classes, I've collaborated with peers and 
                    startups to deliver exceptional results. I'm passionate about clean code, 
                    elegant design, and solving complex problems.

                        <h3>Multimodal Rating Prediction with Spatial Features</h3>
                        <p>Developed a multimodal rating prediction model using Ridge regression to forecast user ratings on Google Local reviews, combining text embeddings from review content, business metadata, and spatial density features. 
                            Achieved 10-15% RMSE improvement over baseline models by integrating these complementary data sources, demonstrating that simple linear approaches can effectively handle complex multimodal data.</p>

                            method to predict single-cell gene expression responses to genetic perturbations across 18,080 genes. 
                            Trained a graph neural network model on 221,273 cells with CRISPR perturbations, generating synthetic perturbed cell populations for validation set submission while incorporating control cells from the training data.</p>

                        <p>Investigated mitotic wave synchronization in starfish embryos using light-sheet microscopy, 
                            capturing 10+ hour time-lapse videos of embryogenesis from 32-cell to 2000-cell stages with fluorescent membrane staining. 
                            Developed image analysis pipelines for nucleus detection and tracking using morphological operations (top-hat transform, Otsu thresholding) and TrackMate software to extract spatiotemporal patterns of coordinated cell divisions across the developing embryo.</p>

                        <p>Investigated mitotic wave synchronization in starfish embryos using light-sheet microscopy, developing a label-free self-supervised Noise2Void deep learning pipeline for denoising time-lapse embryogenesis videos (T×C×Y×X) with ROI-aware processing and automated quality assessment. 
                            Implemented image analysis workflows combining morphological operations (top-hat transform, Otsu thresholding) and TrackMate tracking to extract spatiotemporal patterns of coordinated cell divisions, significantly improving data quality (higher PSNR/SSIM) and reducing manual analysis time.</p>

                        <h3>Life Expectancy</h3>
                        <p>This study analyzes the main factors influencing life expectancy across different countries and continents using statistical models. 
                            The analysis highlights economic capacity and health infrastructure as the most significant determinants of life expectancy, providing insights into potential policy measures for global health improvement. 
                            Various regression techniques, including linear, LASSO, and KNN, were used to model and predict life expectancy trends effectively.</p>

                        <p>This project visualizes Bluebikes traffic data in the Boston metropolitan area using Mapbox GL JS and D3.js. 
                            The interactive map displays bike stations, bike lanes, and traffic patterns across different times of the day. 
                            Each station is represented by a circle whose size and color provide meaningful insights into traffic volume and flow direction.</p>

                        <h3>Occupation of Japan</h3>
                        <p>This paper examines the post-World War II Allied occupation of Japan, focusing on political, economic, and social reforms. 
                            It highlights key changes such as the new constitution, land redistribution, and educational restructuring, while analyzing the challenges of economic recovery and political stability. 
                            The paper concludes by discussing how these reforms shaped Japan's emergence as a peaceful and prosperous nation.</p>
